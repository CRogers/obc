(* The parse tables contain a number of sparse rows: a row of
actions for each state, indexed by the lookahead token; and a row
of gotos for each nonterminal, indexed by the uncovered state.
Several of these rows may be the same: for example, it's common for
multiple states to share the same action row.  So this module
manages the rows, first sharing those that appear more than once,
and second by packing them into a 'checked table'.

The checked table consists of two arrays, table and check.  Each
non-empty row v packed into the table has a distinct base b, with
the property that v[i] is non-zero only if (b+i) is within the bounds
of the arrays and check[b+i] = i; the value of v[i] is then given by
table[b+i].  The cells used by different rows can be interleaved
arbitrarily, provided that two occupied cells do not clash, and each
row has a distinct base.  Then the element v[i], stored at
table[b+i], cannot be mistaken for the element v'[j] even if b+i =
b'+j, because b <> b' implies i <> j, so check[b'+j] <> j. *)
