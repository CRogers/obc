Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler
Acknowledgements and Thanks

The Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler is written in Objective CAML, and thanks
go to the INRIA team for providing a highly productive but lightweight
implementation language, and a convincing demonstration that
bytecode-based language implementations can still be small, fast and
usable.  Of course, large amounts of runtime and library code from the
Objective CAML system form part of the Oberon-2 compiler binary.
However, once compiled, Oberon-2 programs do not depend on any code
from Objective CAML.
