(* The switching code consists of a binary tree of 2-way comparisons
with equality comparisons, range tests and jump tables at the leaves.
A jump table is acceptable if its density -- defined as the number of
non-default entries over the size of the table -- is at least rho; but
we use the adjustment that each range counts at most alpha to the
count of a jump table that covers it, because a range is very compact
representation of a list of contiguous cases.

Unaggregated: 
  one split CONST n / TESTGEQ = 4 bytes or more, 
  range test CONST a / CONST b / JRANGE = 6bytes or more, 
  total = 10 bytes or more

Aggregated:
  2 bytes per jump table entry

So we take alpha = 6 *)

let rho = 0.5				(* Minimum density of jump table *)
let maxtable = 127			(* Max size of jump table *)
let alpha = 6				(* Equivalent cases for range *)

(* The |merge| function is used twice to merge case labels in
different ways.  The idea is that |join| is a function that either
combines two adjacent elements of a (sorted) list, or raises
|Not_found|.  The |merge| function greedily merges elements with
|join| until no more merging is possible. *)

(* |merge| -- combine adjacent elements of list *)
let merge join xs = 
  let rec add x =
    function
	[] -> [x]
      | y::ys ->
	  try add (join x y) ys with Not_found -> x::y::ys in
  List.fold_right add xs []

(* We begin with a list of ranges.  We can glue together adjacent
contiguous ranges that have the same label, even if the programmer
didn't specify a range.  For example, we can convert 1, 2, 3..10 
into 1..10: *)

(* |join_ranges| -- glue together adjacent ranges, if possible *)

  if lo2 = integer_add hi1 (integer 1) && lab1 = lab2 then
    (lo1, hi2, lab1)
  else
    raise Not_found

(* The next stage of the algorithm works on jump tables: it starts with
many separate tables, then merges them, as long as the density of the
combined table is at least the parameter rho.  The greedy algorithm is
sub-optimal, but good enough.  There is an optimal quadratic algorithm
that uses dynamic programming.

Type |table| represents a single jump table.  Each element is a range
of values associated with the same label; if the jump table consists of
a single such range, it can be implemented with a single range check,
and no actual table is needed. *)

  let c = integer_add (integer_sub hi lo) (integer 1) in
  { lowest = lo; highest = hi; ranges = [r];
    count = min c (integer alpha) }

(* |join_tables| -- if the result is dense enough, merge two jump tables *)
let join_tables t1 t2 =
  let c = integer_add t1.count t2.count in
  let n = integer_add (integer_sub t2.highest t1.lowest) (integer 1) in

      && n <= integer maxtable then

      count = integer_add t1.count t2.count; 
      ranges = t1.ranges @ t2.ranges }
  else
    raise Not_found

(* Next, we come to the routines that output the code.  The function
|gen_range| deals with a range of values for the same label, and
treats a range of one element as a special case.  The function
|gen_table| generates a true jump table, or a linear search if the
table would be very small.  These functions are used by |gen_tree| to
generate a binary search tree with jump tables or range tests at the
leaves. *)
