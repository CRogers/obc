(* This module provides an alternative implementation of arrays that
grow as needed to accommodate the indices used in assignments. *)

type 'a t

(* create -- make an empty vector with a specified initial capacity *)
val create : int -> 'a t

(* clear -- make vector empty again *)
val clear : 'a t -> unit

(* get -- fetch element at given index *)
val get : 'a t -> int -> 'a

(* size -- get current number of elements *)
val size : 'a t -> int

(* set -- change element at given index *)  
val set : 'a t -> int -> 'a -> unit

(* append -- add new element at the end *)
val append : 'a t -> 'a -> unit

val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
