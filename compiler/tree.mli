(*
This module describes the type of abstract syntax trees that is used
as the main interface between parts of the comipler.  A tree is built
by the parser, then checked by the semantic analyser, which annotates
identifiers in the tree with their definitions.  The intermediate code
generator finally traverses the tree, emitting code for each
expression or statement.

This module also contains some functions that are used to build the
tree initially; they construct nodes with default values for the
annotations.  Proper values are filled in later during semantic
analysis.
