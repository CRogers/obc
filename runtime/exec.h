/* 
The binary file output by the linker and input by the run-time
interpreter consists of several segments followed by a trailer that
describes the layout of the segments.  The segments may be preceded
by a block of arbitrary data, but they must appear in the following order:

    CODE, DATA, RELOC, SYMTAB

By using a trailer rather than a header, we allow for a binary file
also to be a valid file in another format that uses a header -- like
the executable format of most operating systems including various
Unixes and MS--DOS.  In that format, our code is just junk beyond the
end of the file, and it is usually ignored.  So we can make
self-contained executables by concatenating the interpreter with the
code for a program. This idea was stolen from CAML Light.
