(This is out of date: since OCaml 2.11, building requires Cygwin)

To build Windows version:

1. Install MSYS + MsysDTK + TCL/Tk, MinGW, OCaml for MinGW, Inno
setup, Subversion for Windows.  

Make sure HOME does not contain spaces (else #! scripts don't
work).

I added two scripts to /usr/local/bin: tclsh links to tclsh84, and iscc
links to "/c/Program Files/Inno Setup 5/iscc".  Both shell scripts, because
there are no links, symbolic or otherwise.

2. Check out sources with SVN.  Use svn first from a command prompt, and
enter the password there -- doesn't work from the shell window -- then

	svn co svn://spivey/usr/svn/src/obc/branches/2.5 obc-2.5

3. Run

	winport/winconfig 
	make
	(cd test; make; regress -nocode)

4. To package:

	cd winport
	make

5. Deliver obc2-5-0.exe (or whatever).
