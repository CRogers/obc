Oxford Oberon-2 compiler for Windows

The compiler runs as a console application under any version of
Windows from Windows 95 on.  The programs it builds also run as
console applications.

The compiler comes as a self-extracting installation program with a
name like OBC2-4-0.EXE.  To install the compiler, run this program and
accept the defaults that are offered, so that the files are extracted
into the directory C:\Program Files\Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler.

On Windows 95, 98 and ME, you must finish the installation manually by
adding this directory to the Windows path as follows: edit the file
C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT and add the line

	set path="%path%;C:\Program Files\Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler"

at the end, and reboot your machine.  On Windows NT, 2000 and XP, the
installation directory is added to the path automatically, and there
is no need to reboot.

The compiler can now be run as the program "obc" at the command
prompt.  To check the installation, try compiling and running the
program Fac.m that is comes with the compiler:

	copy "C:\Program Files\Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler\Fac.m" Fac.m
	obc -o fac.exe Fac.m
	fac 10

This should give as output, "The factorial of 10 is 3628800".
